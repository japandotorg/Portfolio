# Portfolio

My Personal Portfolio Website

# Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone the repo into your desired folder, `cd` into it, and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/japandotorg/Portfolio.git
$ cd Portfolio
$ npm install | $ yarn install
```

I personally prefer yarn more but in the end of the day it's your choice/wish what node package manager you wish to use. You can use `npm run serve` or `yarn serve` to open up a local version of the site at https://localhost:8080/. If you need to use a different port, run it as `npm run serve -- --port=3000` or `yarn serve -- --port=3000`, or if you need to use a different host, run it as `npm run serve -- --host 0.0.0.0` or `yarn serve -- --host 0.0.0.0`.
